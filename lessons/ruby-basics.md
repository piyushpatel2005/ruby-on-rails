# Ruby Basics

Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz). It is dynamic, object-oriented language. It is influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel and Lisp.


```ruby
3.times { puts "Hello World" }
```

In Ruby, use 2 space indentation. # is used for comments. `p` is also used to print internal representation of an object. Ruby variables should be lowercased with snake_case convention. Constants are capital whereas classes and modules are Camel case. We don't need semi colons in Ruby code. For writing multiple statements in same line (which is not recommended), we can use semicolons.

We can run Ruby in interactive mode. We can open Ruby interactive shell by typing `irb` in shell.

Relational operations:
In Ruby, `false` and `nil` are the only objects that are false.

```ruby
puts "0 is true" if 0 # => 0 is true 
puts "false is true?" if "false" # => false is true? 
puts "no way - false is false" if false # => NOTHING PRINTED
puts "empty string is true" if "" # => empty string is true 
puts "nil is true?" if "nil" # => nil is true? 
puts "no way - nil is false" if nil # => NOTHING PRINTED
```

## Conditionals

The conditional control structure looks like this:

```ruby
a = 5 # declare a variable

if  a == 3                    
  puts "a is 3"                  
elsif a == 5 
  puts "a is 5"                   
else                              
  puts "a is not 3 or 5"
end 

# => a is 5

a = 5 

unless a == 6
  puts "a is not 6"
end

# => a is not 6
```

Ruby has modifier form which makes the code very readable.

```ruby
# if modifier form

a = 5 
b = 0 

puts "One liner" if a == 5 and b == 0 
# => One liner

# while modifier form

times_2 = 2 
times_2 *= 2 while times_2 < 100 
puts times_2 # => 128
```

Ruby has triple equals operation which allows to compare regular expression.

```ruby
if /sera/ === "coursera"
  puts "Triple Equals"
end
# => Triple Equals

if "coursera" === "coursera"
  puts "also works"
end
# => also works

if Integer === 21
  puts "21 is an Integer"
end
```

In Ruby, there are two types of case expressions.

```ruby
age = 21

case # 1ST FLAVOR
  when age >= 21
    puts "You can buy a drink" 
  when 1 == 0 
    puts "Written by a drunk programmer"  
  else 
    puts "Default condition"
end 
# => You can buy a drink

name = 'Fisher' 
case name # 2nd FLAVOR
  when /fish/i then puts "Something is fishy here"
  when 'Smith' then puts "Your name is Smith"
end

#=> Something is fishy here
```

## Loops

For loop:

```ruby
for i in 0..2 
  puts i 
end 
```

While loop:

```ruby
a = 10

while a > 9 
  puts a                      
  a -= 1 
  # same as a = a - 1
end

# => 10

# Until Example
a = 9

until a >= 10 
  puts a                       
  a += 1                       
end 

# => 9
```

## Functions

In Ruby, every function/method has at least one class it belongs to. For functions, parenthese are optional both when defining and calling a method. We don't need to declare the datatypes for each parameters. The last expression in the method is the return value for that method, `return` keyword is optional. We can have methods ending with `?`. The methods ending with `!` show methods with side effects.

```ruby

def can_divide_by?(number)
  return false if number.zero?
  true
end

puts can_divide_by? 3 # => true
puts can_divide_by? 0 # => false
```

We can also pass default arguments to methods.

```ruby
def factorial_with_default (n = 5) 
   n == 0? 1 : n * factorial_with_default(n - 1) 
end 

puts factorial 5 # => 120
puts factorial_with_default # => 120 
puts factorial_with_default(3) # => 6
```

Splat arguments allow to pass multiple parameters to methods.

```ruby
def max(one_param, *numbers, another)
  # Variable length parameters passed in 
  # become an array
  numbers.max
end

puts max("something", 7, 32, -4, "more") # => 32
```

In Ruby, **blocks** are iterators. They are usually inside curly braces or inside `do...end` keywords.

```ruby
1.times { puts "Hello World!" }   
# => Hello World! 

2.times do |index| 
  if index > 0 
    puts index 
  end 
end 
# => 1

2.times { |index| puts index if index > 0 }
```

We can use blocks in our code as follows. With implicit method, we use `block_given?` to verify if the block is given. In the explicit way, we include `&` in argument to see if we received any block. If we received block, we call `call` method of the block.

```ruby
# Implicit blocks
def two_times_implicit 
  return "No block" unless block_given? 
  yield 
  yield 
end 

puts two_times_implicit { print "Hello "} # => Hello 
										  # => Hello 
puts two_times_implicit # => No block

# Explicit block
def two_times_explicit (&i_am_a_block) 
  return "No block" if i_am_a_block.nil? 
  i_am_a_block.call 
  i_am_a_block.call 
end 

puts two_times_explicit # => No block 
two_times_explicit { puts "Hello"} # => Hello 
                                   # => Hello 
```

## Files

```ruby
# Reading from a file.
if File.exist? 'test.txt'

  File.foreach( 'test.txt' ) do |line|
    puts line.chomp
  end
end

# Handling exception

begin

  File.foreach( 'do_not_exist.txt' ) do |line|   
    puts line.chomp 
  end

rescue Exception => e
  puts e.message
  puts "Let's pretend this didn't happen..."
end

# Write to a file
# Closing file automatically once block is executed.

File.open("test1.txt", "w") do |file|  
  file.puts "One line"
  file.puts "Another" 
end

# Read and write to environment variable
puts ENV["EDITOR"] # => subl
```

## Strings

Strings can be written with single quotes and double quotes. Only double quoted strings allow for string interpolation as well as interpretation of special escape characters. With `%Q`, we can create multi-line string.

```ruby
single_quoted = 'ice cream \n followed by it\'s a party!'
double_quoted = "ice cream \n followed by it\'s a party!" 

puts single_quoted # => ice cream \n followed by it's a party!
puts double_quoted # => ice cream 
                   # =>   followed by it's a party! 

def multiply (one, two) 
  "#{one} multiplied by #{two} equals #{one * two}" 
end 
puts multiply(5, 3) 
# => 5 multiplied by 3 equals 15

my_name = " tim" 
puts my_name.lstrip.capitalize # => Tim 
p my_name # => " tim" 
my_name.lstrip! # (destructive) removes the leading space 
my_name[0] = 'K' # replace the fist character 
puts my_name # => Kim 

cur_weather = %Q{It's a hot day outside 
			     Grab your umbrellasâ€¦} 

cur_weather.lines do |line| 
  line.sub! 'hot', 'rainy' # substitute 'hot' with 'rainy' 
  puts "#{line.strip}" 
end 
# => It's a rainy day outside 
# => Grab your umbrellas...
```

Strings api includes many useful methods. Another kind of string is symbol. Symbol is `:` followed by a string. They are highly optimized strings. They are constant names which we don't need to declare before using. Symbols are guaranteed to be unique and immutable. We can convert to string using `to_s` or we can convert string to symbol using `to_sym` method. They are used for method names or keys in Hashes.

We can get all methods names for any object using `"hello".methods.grep /case/` which will give all methods that include "case" word in method names.
